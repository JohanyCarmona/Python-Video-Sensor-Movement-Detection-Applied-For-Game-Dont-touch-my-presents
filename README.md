# Webcam Motion Detection Component Added To The Python Game: Don't Touch My Presents

![](https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTgyNzExMi8xMDcyNTIzOS5naWY=/347x500/1OA7GI.gif)

## How to Play

* Through an object on motion (e.g. hand) captured by the web cam.
* You can still using the arrow keys your maneuver your hand out of the way.

## Practice

This an academic practice in order to get knowledge about the different digital image pre-processing techniques for video manipulation. For this case, the purpose of the developing is to handle the game through motion detection by the webcam of the user.

### Settings

The Webcam motion detection has three main properties that contributes to the performance, sensibility, and the size of the detected object. You can configure it by the "main.py" file.

* DELAY: The delay time in seconds before to make a new update of the static image captured as background. (Recommended: 0.021 seconds)
* CONTOUR_RECTANGLE: The sensibility level of the differences contour found after the rest of pixels applied to the comparing images. (Recommended: 3400)
* MINIMUM_CONTOUR_TYPE: If this property is setted as True, then the module will detect the smallest motioned object found in the camera record, otherwise it will detect the biggest motioned object. (Recommended: False)
